    "Welcome to this practical implementation, where we delve into the world of computer vision using PyTorch. Our goal is to develop a practical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by implementing a model that can classify different types of clothing. This demo is designed for learners at all levels, so don't worry if some concepts seem new. We'll walk through each step of the process, explaining the key ideas and code details along the way."

    "\n",
    "In this demo, we use the `Fashion MNIST` dataset, a modern alternative to the classic [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset traditionally used for handwriting recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion MNIST comprises 70,000 grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels, distributed across 10 different clothing categories. These images are small, detailed, and varied enough to challenge our model while being simple enough for straightforward processing and quick training times.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Training Set:** This includes `train_images` and `train_labels`. These are the arrays that our model will learn from. The model sees these images and their corresponding labels, adjusting its weights and biases to reduce classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Set:** This comprises `test_images` and `test_labels`. These are used to evaluate how well our model performs on data it has never seen before. This is crucial for understanding the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 NumPy array. The pixel values range from 0 to 255, with 0 being black, 255 being white, and the various shades of gray in between. The labels are integers from 0 to 9, each representing a specific category of clothing.\n",
    "Class Names\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset doesn't include the names of the clothing classes, so we will manually define them for clarity when visualizing our results. Here's the mapping:\n",
